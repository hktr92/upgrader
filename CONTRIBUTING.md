============

if you want to contribute to this project, here's what you should know:

- i'm using Atom text editor;
- the development is active over `bin/upgrader` shell script;
- function declaration must have the "function" keyword;
- local variables should have the "local" keyword;
- if a variable doesn't have the "local" keyword, you must "unset" it!;
- currently there's only two exit code classes. class 1 is currently reserved (currently unused) and class 2 is for missing or unaccessible files / directories.
